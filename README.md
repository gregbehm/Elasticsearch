# Demonstrating Elasticsearch  

From *Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide - Preface*

> Elasticsearch is a distributed, scalable, real-time search and analytics engine. It enables you to search, analyze, and explore your data, often in ways that you did not anticipate at the start of a project. It exists because raw data sitting on a hard drive is just not useful.

The accompanying notebook, Elasticsearch.ipynb, demonstrates some of the basics of using Elasticsearch to store, search, and analyze data. It only scratches the surface of what you can do with Elasticsearch, so check out the extensive Elastic Stack documentation collection [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html).
