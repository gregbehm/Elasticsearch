# Demonstrating Elasticsearch  

From the Preface to *Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide*

> Elasticsearch is a distributed, scalable, real-time search and analytics engine. It enables you to search, analyze, and explore your data, often in ways that you did not anticipate at the start of a project. It exists because raw data sitting on a hard drive is just not useful.

The accompanying notebook, Elasticsearch.ipynb, demonstrates a few basics of using Elasticsearch to store, search, and analyze data. Examples are implemented using the Python ```elasticsearch``` and ```elasticsearch_dsl``` modules.

This demonstration notebook only scratches the surface of what you can do with Elasticsearch, so check out the extensive Elastic Stack documentation collection [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html).
